D3.js Bubble Chart: Twitter Abuse

This code relates to a post showing tweet rates around the controversial rape trial of UK footballer Ched Evans.

It uses d3 and coffeescript.

The Force Layout component of D3.js is used here to provide most of the functionality behind the transitions, animations, and collisions in the visualization.
Here, however, we forgo the use of edges and instead use it just to move around the nodes of a graph.

The bubbles are color coded based on tweet amount. The main part of the code is written in CoffeeScript. Everything is packaged up in a nice BubbleChart class.
